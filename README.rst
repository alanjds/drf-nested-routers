drf-nested-routers
==================

This package provides routers and relations to create nested resources
in the `Django Rest Framework <http://django-rest-framework.org/>`__

Nested resources are needed for full REST URL structure, if one resource
lives inside another.

The following example is about Domains and DNS Nameservers. There are
many domains, and each domain has many nameservers. The "nameserver"
resource does not exist without a domain, so you need it "nested" inside
the domain.

Installation
------------

You can install this library using pip:

``pip install drf-nested-routers``

Quickstart
----------

The desired URL signatures are:

::

    \domain\ <- Domains list
    \domain\{pk}\ <- One domain, from {pk]
    \domain\{domain_pk}\nameservers\ <- Nameservers of domain from {domain_pk}
    \domain\{domain_pk}\nameservers\{pk} <- Specific nameserver from {pk}, of domain from {domain_pk}

How to do it (example):

.. code:: python

    # urls.py
    from rest_framework_nested import routers
    from views import DomainViewSet, NameserverViewSet
    (...)

    router = routers.SimpleRouter()
    router.register(r'domains', DomainViewSet)

    domains_router = routers.NestedSimpleRouter(router, r'domains', lookup='domain')
    domains_router.register(r'nameservers', NameserverViewSet)

    urlpatterns = patterns('',
        url(r'^', include(router.urls)),
        url(r'^', include(domains_router.urls)),
    )

.. code:: python

    # views.py
    class NameserverViewSet(viewsets.ViewSet):
        def list(self, request, domain_pk=None):
            nameservers = self.queryset.filter(domain=domain_pk)
            (...)
            return Response([...])

        def retrieve(self, request, pk=None, domain_pk=None):
            nameservers = self.queryset.get(pk=pk, domain=domain_pk)
            (...)
            return Response(serializer.data)
